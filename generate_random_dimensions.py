    """
    Produce a random shape (a tuple of positive integers) that can be used to
    initialise a multi-dimensional array or tensor, while satisfying optional
    arithmetic constraints on the shape.

    Inputs
    ------
    num_dimensions : int
        Number of axes to generate. If 0, the function returns an empty tuple.
    min_size : int
        Inclusive lower bound for every dimension. Default is 1.
    max_size : int
        Inclusive upper bound for every dimension. Must be greater than or
        equal to min_size. Default is 10.
    total_elements : Optional[int]
        If provided, the product of all returned dimensions must be exactly
        this value. Default is None.
    gcd_constraint : Optional[int]
        If provided, the greatest common divisor of all returned dimensions
        must be exactly this value. Equivalently, every dimension must be
        a multiple of gcd_constraint and at least one dimension must equal
        gcd_constraint. Default is None.
    rng : Optional[random.Random]
        The random number generator to be used. If None (default), the
        global generator in the random module is used. Supplying an explicit
        random.Random instance allows callers to obtain deterministic
        output by seeding that instance themselves.

    Outputs
    -------
    Tuple[int, ...]
        A tuple of length num_dimensions such that:
        - Every element is between min_size and max_size (inclusive)
        - The product of the elements equals total_elements if that
          argument is not None
        - The greatest common divisor of the elements equals
          gcd_constraint if that argument is not None

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If num_dimensions is negative.
    ValueError
        If min_size is less than 1.
    ValueError
        If max_size is less than min_size.
    ValueError
        If total_elements is not None and is less than 1.
    ValueError
        If gcd_constraint is not None and is less than 1.
    ValueError
        If both total_elements and gcd_constraint are supplied but they
        cannot be simultaneously satisfied by any tuple that also respects
        the size bounds.
    ValueError
        If no tuple satisfying the requested constraints can be found.

    Assumptions
    -----------
    The caller never relies on any specific ordering of the returned
    dimensionsâ€”the tuple may be in any order chosen by the implementation.

    When num_dimensions is 0, the only admissible value for total_elements
    (if supplied) is 1, because the product of an empty set of numbers is
    conventionally one.

    When multiple valid solutions exist that satisfy all constraints, the
    function selects one uniformly at random (or pseudo-randomly if an rng
    is provided).
